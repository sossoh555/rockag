function state = gaplotscores(options,state,flag)
%GAPLOTSCORES Plots the scores of every member of the population.
%   STATE = GAPLOTSCORES(OPTIONS,STATE,FLAG) plots the scores of  every
%   member of the population. The individuals are ordered as follows.  The
%   first (leftmost) n individuals are the elites (by default 2), these will
%   always be the lowest scores. The next (Middle) group is the individuals
%   that were created by crossover and finally the last (rightmost) group
%   are those individuals created by mutation.
%
%   You can get an idea of the relative behavior of each of these groups. 
%   In particular you can gauge the relative contributions of mutation and
%   crossover and adjust the crossover fraction accordingly.
%
%   If you are using multiple populations, this entire pattern will be
%   repeated in a different color for each subpopulation. You can see which
%   population is outperforming the others and watch the effects of migration
%   between subpopulations.
%
%   Example:
%    Create an options structure that uses GAPLOTSCORES
%    as the plot function
%      options = gaoptimset('PlotFcns',@gaplotscores);
